## Abstract

- Spatial transcriptomics is a recent technique used to capture the spatial distribution of messenger RNA sequences within tissue sections.
- The technique is used on a biopsy sample to produce a matrix of gene expression levels for that sample.
- Deep learning computer vision algorithms are introduced to analyze the biopsy image.
- When combined with the gene expression levels matrix, a trained model is produced that learns the connection between a matrix entry and its relevant image.
- The goal is, to be able to produce a close-as-posibble approximation to real gene expression levels, using the biopsy image alone.

### Step 3

- **Enjoy**
    - better performance when ran on a gpu

- **Consider using different hyperparameter values**
    - better performance when ran on a gpu

## FAQ

- **How can I get the data ?**
    - good question :smile: ?
- **This or that doesnt work... what to do?**
    - No problem! Just do this.
